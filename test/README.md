# Running the tests from the command line

You can run the unit tests from the command line by entering

    rake test

in the *top level* directory of the distribution. This, however,
requires that you have installed ruby and rake (`gem install rake`).


# Running the unit tests directly from your brower

Open the file `run_unit_tests.html` in your browser. You can choose
which test to run in the left frame. The test results will appear in
the right frame.


# Creating new tests

You can use the file `_test_tmpl.html` as a basis for you new tests.
